# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-on-Car-Dataset
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a car dataset. The dataset contains information about various car models, including their make, model, year, engine specifications, transmission type, fuel type, mileage, price, and other attributes.

The goal of this project is to analyze the dataset, gain insights into the relationships between different variables, identify patterns and trends, and visualize the data using various plots and charts. The EDA process will help us understand the characteristics of the cars in the dataset and explore how different features are related to each other.

### Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn

### Steps:
Loading the dataset: The car dataset will be loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: The dataset will be examined for missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant columns. Any necessary data cleaning and preprocessing steps will be performed, such as dropping duplicates, handling missing values, and removing irrelevant columns.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Various EDA techniques will be applied to explore the dataset. This includes statistical analysis, visualization of distributions, correlations between variables, and identification of outliers. Plots such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps will be used to visualize the data.

Interpretation and Insights: The findings from the EDA will be interpreted to gain insights into the dataset. Relationships between different variables will be analyzed, and any interesting patterns or trends will be highlighted.

Documentation: The analysis process, findings, and visualizations will be documented in a clear and concise manner.
